          To make over-medium eggs, first turn the stove on medium heat. After a few minutes, put a tablespoon of vegetable oil (or your choice of cooking oil) on the pan. Spread the oil on the pan and allow it to heat up. Next, crack the egg on the side of the pan and empty the egg onto the hot pan. Cook the egg for 3-5 minutes and sprinkle the seasoning of your choice on the top of the egg. With the spatula, flip the egg and cook the raw side of the egg for about 2-3 minutes. Add seasoning to the bottom side of the egg if necessary. Lastly, scoop the egg off of the pan with the spatula and onto your plate to eat. Enjoy!
