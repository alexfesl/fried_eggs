        <p>To make sunny-side up eggs, first turn the stove on medium heat. After a few minutes, put a tablespoon of vegetable oil (or your choice of cooking oil) on the pan. Spread the oil on the pan and allow it to heat up.</p>
        <p>Next, crack the egg on the side of the pan and empty the egg onto the hot pan. Cook the egg for 3-5 minutes. </p>
        <p>Lastly, sprinkle the seasoning of your choice on top of the egg. With the spatula, scoop the egg off of the pan and onto your plate to eat. Enjoy!</p>
